# SimpleCompiler

Compiler for language partialy defined in kalba_BNF.txt file. Language code is compiled to 8086 architecture. Compilation result is COM executable file. I was able to run it in DosBox emulator.

It supports functions, integer aritmethics, bool aritmethics('and', 'or' and 'not' operators), sigle dimentional arrays as pointers. FLoat aritmethics don't work.
There is multiline comments /**/, if-else statements, while statement.

Programed example of snake game is in file named "gyvatele"
